        <h2>The Story : The Lion King</h2>
        <h3>The movie opens in the Pride Lands, a vibrant savannah ruled by the noble lion king Mufasa. He and his queen, Sarabi, proudly present their newborn son, Simba, to the kingdom, heralding Simba as the future king.

            As Simba grows, Mufasa teaches him about the responsibilities of kingship and the delicate balance of life, known as the "Circle of Life." However, Mufasa’s jealous brother, Scar, covets the throne for himself. In a cunning plot, Scar lures Simba into a dangerous gorge, where a wildebeest stampede threatens his life. In an act of bravery, Mufasa saves Simba, but Scar betrays Mufasa, causing him to fall to his death.
            
            Scar convinces the young Simba that he is responsible for his father's death, and overwhelmed by guilt, Simba flees the Pride Lands. Scar takes over as king, forming an alliance with the hyenas and plunging the kingdom into ruin.
            
            Simba, meanwhile, is found by Timon (a meerkat) and Pumbaa (a warthog), who adopt him and teach him their carefree philosophy of "Hakuna Matata" (no worries). Simba grows up with them, but his past catches up when his childhood friend, Nala, finds him and urges him to return to reclaim the throne. Initially reluctant, Simba eventually encounters Rafiki, a wise mandrill who helps him realize that his father’s spirit lives on within him.
            
            With newfound courage, Simba returns to the Pride Lands, challenges Scar, and reveals the truth about Mufasa's death. A battle ensues, and Scar is ultimately defeated by the hyenas he once ruled over.
            
            Simba takes his rightful place as king, restoring balance to the Pride Lands. The movie ends with Simba and Nala presenting their newborn cub to the kingdom, completing the Circle of Life.
            
            Themes of family, responsibility, and the journey to self-discovery are central to the movie, making The Lion King a timeless tale.</h3>
