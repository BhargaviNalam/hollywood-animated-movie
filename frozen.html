        <h2>The Story : Moana</h2>
        <h3>Frozen tells the story of two royal sisters, Elsa and Anna, in the kingdom of Arendelle. Elsa, the elder sister, is born with magical ice powers that she struggles to control. After an accident in their childhood, Elsa isolates herself from Anna and the world to prevent causing harm. But on her coronation day, Elsa's powers are revealed to everyone, and in her panic, she unintentionally plunges the kingdom into an eternal winter.

            Elsa flees to the mountains, where she creates an ice palace, believing she is safer alone. However, her sister Anna, full of optimism and love, sets off to find her and bring her back. Along the way, Anna teams up with an ice harvester named Kristoff, his loyal reindeer Sven, and Olaf, a cheerful snowman created by Elsa's magic. They face many challenges, including harsh weather and a deceptive prince, Hans, who has his own plans for the throne.
            
            In the end, the central theme of the story emerges—love, particularly the bond between sisters, is more powerful than fear. Through Anna's selflessness, Elsa learns that love can help her control her powers and restore peace to Arendelle.
            
            The journey, full of adventure and discovery, resonates with themes of self-acceptance, courage, and the importance of family, much like how every challenge in life often brings us closer to the people and parts of ourselves we need to embrace.</h3>
