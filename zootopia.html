        <h2>The Story : Zoopotia </h2>
        <h3>In **Zootopia**, Judy Hopps is a small-town rabbit with big dreams of becoming a police officer in the sprawling city of Zootopia, a place where animals of all species live together. Despite skepticism from others who believe that a rabbit can’t handle the job, Judy graduates from the police academy and heads to the city. However, she’s quickly relegated to parking duty by Chief Bogo, who doubts her abilities.

            While on duty, Judy encounters a sly fox named Nick Wilde, a small-time con artist. She later uncovers that Nick may hold a clue to a bigger case: the mysterious disappearance of several predator animals across the city. Judy convinces Nick to help her in exchange for keeping his illegal activities a secret. The two form an unlikely partnership as they dig deeper into the conspiracy.
            
            Their investigation reveals that the missing predators have been going “savage” — reverting to their primal instincts. They eventually discover that the true culprit is Assistant Mayor Bellwether, who is using a toxic plant serum to make predators aggressive in an attempt to incite fear and maintain control over Zootopia. Bellwether is arrested, and the city returns to peace.
            
            By the end, Judy and Nick become close friends, and Nick even joins the police force, showing that anyone, no matter their background, can be anything they want to be. The film delivers a powerful message about overcoming prejudice and embracing diversity.</h3>
