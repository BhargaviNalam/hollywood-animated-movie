        <h2>The Story : Aladdin</h2>
        <h3>Aladdin (1992) is an animated Disney musical adventure set in the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah. The story follows Aladdin, a poor "diamond in the rough" street thief, who dreams of a better life. One day, Aladdin meets Princess Jasmine, who has snuck out of the palace to explore the city, and the two form a connection. However, Aladdin is soon caught by the guards under the orders of Jafar, the evil Royal Vizier, who seeks to use Aladdin to retrieve a magical Genie’s lamp from the Cave of Wonders.

            Once inside the cave, Aladdin finds the lamp and accidentally summons the Genie, a powerful, shape-shifting spirit who can grant three wishes. With the Genie’s help, Aladdin transforms into Prince Ali, a wealthy and royal figure, so he can court Princess Jasmine. Along the way, Aladdin builds a bond with the Genie, realizing that the Genie desires freedom from the lamp. Meanwhile, Jafar is scheming to take over Agrabah by controlling both the lamp and the Sultan.
            
            As Aladdin tries to win Jasmine’s heart, he faces several challenges, including Jafar’s nefarious plot to seize power and his own internal struggle with whether to continue pretending to be someone he’s not. Ultimately, Aladdin defeats Jafar in a battle of wits, and with his final wish, he frees the Genie, showing his true noble character.
            
            In the end, Aladdin and Jasmine are free to be together, and the Genie is liberated to travel the world. The film ends on a joyful note, celebrating themes of love, friendship, and being true to oneself.</h3>
