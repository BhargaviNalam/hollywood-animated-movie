        <h2>The Story : Moana</h2>
        <h3>Moana Waialiki, a young and brave Polynesian girl, is the daughter of Chief Tui, the leader of the island of Motunui. Since childhood, Moana has been drawn to the ocean, despite her father’s warnings that it is dangerous. He wants her to stay on the island and one day become the chief. However, Moana’s grandmother, Gramma Tala, encourages her to listen to the calling of the ocean and explore what lies beyond the reef.

            The island begins to suffer from a mysterious blight: the fish disappear, and crops fail. Gramma Tala reveals to Moana that the ocean has chosen her to restore the heart of Te Fiti, a goddess who created all life in the Pacific Islands. The heart was stolen by the demigod Maui, which led to the spread of darkness over the islands.
            
            Determined to save her people, Moana sets sail on a daring journey across the ocean to find Maui and convince him to return the heart. Along the way, she faces numerous challenges, including dangerous creatures and the powerful lava demon, Te Kā. She eventually finds Maui, but he is reluctant to help her at first, having lost his magical fishhook that gave him the ability to shapeshift.
            
            Together, Moana and Maui embark on a journey to confront Te Kā and restore the heart to Te Fiti. Along the way, Moana learns about the history of her ancestors—who were voyagers and wayfinders—and discovers her own strength and courage. Maui also learns to regain his confidence and believes in Moana’s leadership.
            
            In a climactic moment, Moana realizes that Te Kā is actually a transformed Te Fiti, angered and corrupted by the loss of her heart. Moana returns the heart to Te Fiti, restoring her to her original, peaceful form. The darkness fades, the islands are healed, and life returns to normal.
            
            In the end, Moana embraces her role as the future leader of her people and leads them on a new voyage to explore the world, continuing the tradition of her ancestors as a wayfinder</h3>
